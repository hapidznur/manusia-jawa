  Introduction of
 M. Lenore Selenka.
 I.
 The first impetus for the plan to start investigations at the Pitkecanthropus site dates back to 1899. At that time, my husband, Prof. Emil Selenka, went to see Prof. Dubois with me and toured the Pitliecanthropus - ^> i \ xcke. The intense interest they aroused in us, the lively wish that the investigations should be continued and the regret that Mr. Dubois could not make such a continuation probable either from his side or from that of the Dutch government, prompted me even then in the presence of Mr. Dubois on the suggestion that we might consider the continuation ourselves
 should take.
 Even if the special developmental tasks my husband set himself, and
 which filled the last decade of his life and would probably not have allowed him to take up this plan, his interest in the follow-up of those traces of the hitherto most important link in the history of human development remained lively.
 In the autumn of 1902, at the beginning of which I lost my husband, I made the decision to take up the investigation in Java on my own. This happened occasionally when I was present in Holland and after I had received a lively welcome and direct encouragement from Mr Dubois. Mr.Dubois also provided me with some orientation sketches and information and sent me one of his former overseers, a retired Dutch sergeant who had worked for him on the site for years 1
 ).
 I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Dubois for this kind support of my plans.
 At the same time, I obtained the approval of Prof. Treub, who was then in Holland, director of the botanical garden in Buitenzorg and scientific advisor to the government there, to my project and his assurance that he would support the company with his endorsement.
 -
 1) This man was provisionally engaged by me at that time, but unfortunately died the following year. Later I took another Dutch ex-sergeant named de Winter, who had also worked on the site and whom I found with the help of the Dutch colonial ministry, out to Java.

 M. Lenore Selenka,
 Since the years 1903 and 1904 were largely determined by obligations against my husband's academic legacy, I was not able to begin preparing the company until 1905. In the meantime I had initiated related links and information in Java and Holland on the broadest possible basis. It was originally my intention to carry out this undertaking from my own resources and independently of any corporation, only on the basis of the prospect of concession from the Indian and Dutch authorities.
 In the autumn of 1905 I obtained official permission from the Dutch Colonial Ministry to carry out the investigations on Java, and through its mediation my request for permission to work and for permission to export the found objects to the Governor General of India was supported . This request was fully granted in January 1906.
 In the autumn of 1905 the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Academic Jubilee Foundation of the City of Berlin also approached my company with suggestions for support. The negotiations on this dragged on until late autumn 1906. At that time, the Academic Jubilee Foundation of the City of Berlin signed a contract with me, according to which they contributed the sum of 14,000 marks to the excavations and in which it was planned to add another 14,000 marks if this was to carry out the work there according to the plan would be required. According to this plan, the excavations in the actual bone layers (after completion of the necessary preparatory work) should be carried out for at least 3 months. Since the excavations, which were also extended to double the allotted time, actually required far more than three times the first installment in costs *), the foundation approved the second installment at a later date2 ).
 Incidentally, it can only be ascribed to the extraordinary relief granted by the Indian government to the company that the costs of implementation did not have to be much higher. The granting of free labor in such large numbers and the position of the relatively high-paid European supervisors alone represent a significant part of the costs that would otherwise have been necessary.
 For making the entire company possible, thanks primarily to the generous courtesy of the Dutch and Indian governments, namely:
 To His Excellency the Colonial Minister, Mr. D. Fock,
 who gave me the official grant of all powers, insofar as they were subject to the Dutch home government, and advocated granting the rest to the Indian government;
 To His Excellency the Governor General van Nederlandsch-Indie I. B. van Hedtsz,
 who gave me the permission to dig on the Dutch-Indian soil, in addition 25 freelancers (whose number was later tripled) and commanded 2 active military men to supervise them and especially the personal and unrestricted disposal of all natural knowledge brought to light by the expedition -

 granted;
 1) I paid the additional costs myself.
 2) This also included a certain sum for the later publications, which, however, could not cover the costs of the same.
 3) I had to commit myself not to take any finds of any archaeological character out of the country.
 
  Introduction.

 to Mr. D. Fr. M. van Rees, Algemeene Secretaris van Nederlandsch-Indie,
 for his helpful promotion of all interests relating to the expedition before and during its entire duration; then
 the now deceased Prof. Dr. M. Treub, Directeur van het Departement van Landbouw in Nederlandsch-Indie, then director of the botanical garden in Buitenzorg,
 for his advice and support given to me in the years of preparation for the expedition
 support and ongoing promotion of the company.
 In second place, I owe thanks to the Board of Trustees of the Academic Jubilee
 Foundation of the city of Berlin for the extensive support of the expedition and the possibility of a broader base of the same and the Königl. Prussian Academy of Sciences for recommending my company at that point.
 The two-year working period of 1908 owes its funding to the Königl Bavarian Academy of Sciences and the Directory of the Bavarian State Paleontological Collection, to whom I would also like to express my thanks.
 I would also like to thank all those interested in the scientific and other results of the expedition to the following sponsors of the company:
 On Java:
 In Batavia:
 Mr ue Voogd, Overste van Genie zu Batavia,
 who selected the 2 Dutch sergeants to supervise the work in Trinil and who, through the excellent choice of these people as well as through his constant, willing support and helpfulness throughout the course of the expedition, earned an outstanding contribution to their success;
 Mr. Koningk Knyp, boss van Mynwesen (mining),
 who in the most generous way provided us with all the necessary machines, dump trucks, decauville rails, as well as pumps, drills and digging tools and had them transported free of charge for us to the workplace;
 Mr. Styprian Lucius, Head of Spoorwesen (Railway Administration),
 generously granted free transport on all railways for all incoming and outgoing shipments for the entire duration of the expedition, furthermore free travel for all persons affiliated with the expedition 1
 );
 Mr. Stieltje, Chef van Posteryen (postal administration),
 to whom we owed the provision of two free mail runners between Ngawi and Trinil, a perk which, since we were not connected to the post office, saved us great costs and difficulties.
 In Madiun:
 the resident Mr. Boissevain,
 who sent the workers' columns to Trinil and consistently proved to be the patron of the expedition;
 1) This is all the more highly valued as in striking contrast to the fact that here the Dutch-Indian government even granted free freight for the scientific collections that originated in their soil and that were transferred to foreign countries, when the same collections were transported to the German ones Museums to which they were to be sent had to pay the full freight rate for the transport from Bremen to Berlin (almost 400 marks) despite multiple requests from academically authorized parties for exemption or reduction of the costs.

 M. Lenore Selenka,
 the assistant resident Mr. Heckmf.yer in Ngawi,
 who, as Trinil's closest senior official, watched over the fate of the work and has proven himself to be the most benevolent patron;
 the commander of Ngawi Mr. Bloeme,
 the immediate superior of my military supervisor, who made the work much easier with a lot of help and favors.
 I also owe a lot of thanks
 Mr. L. A. Bakhuis, the former Major in the Dutch-Indian Army, now Beferendaris
 at the Ministry of the Colonies in The Hague,
 for the helpful and kind advice and mediation that he gave me for years in all official steps in matters of the expedition.
 I do not want to omit to express my heartfelt thanks to my following advisors and helpers in the preparation of the expedition:
 In Holland:
 Prof. A. Hubrecht in Utrecht,
 Prof. Nieuwenhuis in Leiden,
 Prof. Martin in Leiden,
 Mr. Adrian de Stoop, director of Dordrechtschen Petroleum Maatschappy, and his
 kick in the Tschepu petroleum station, near Trinil; also in Germany:
 Prof. Eberhard Fraas in Stuttgart, Prof. Otto Jaeckel (now Greifswald), Prof. Conrad Oebbecke in Munich, and the writer Wilhelm Bölsche

 Dr. Max Rothmann (doctor) \ in Berlin.
 Dr. Hans Friedenthal

 The members of the expedition granted considerable reductions in the passage and also allowed 20 cbm of free freight for the goods of the expedition. We made use of the latter advantage mainly on the outward journey, while on the return journey we had to use other routes several times to avoid reloading due to the fragility of the finds.
 For the summer of 1906 I had prepared a pre-expedition to Java with a geological expert (and already occupied ship berths), which, however, had to be abandoned due to initially overlooked statutory difficulties with regard to the academic contribution to the foundation that emerged at the last moment .
 I therefore asked Prof. Wilhelm Volz, whom I asked for an orientation visit to Trinil when he left for Sumatra in 1905 and with whom I had agreed to meet there for 1906, to carry out this preliminary examination alone, and asked him about this the workers already promised to me for this working period, as well as the terrain plans and information that I have already procured. At my request, the governor had the two soldiers
 Meyboom and Bai r already commanded on the spot in June 1906 and so, when Prof. Volz arrived in Trinil, they were already there with 25 workers to deal with the arrangements agreed with me

 accept the creation of test pits and carry out the excavations and profile uncoverings necessary for his preliminary investigation. Prof. Volz undertook this preliminary examination in two short visits to Trinil and gave me a short written report on it. It was agreed that if after his departure from Java the workers were allowed to stay in Trinil to continue the work, for which he promised to seek permission from the governmental authorities, he should notify me of this by telegram according to a specially worked out code, because I would then be responsible for the necessary wanted to take care of geological supervision. In the meantime, Herr Volz reported to me that the work would be stopped as soon as he left and that the workers would be sent home, and that work would not be allowed until my own arrival in Java and "everything would have to rest".
 and had prepared to withdraw.
 It was not until January 1907 that I found out through a bill for house holdings I received from Java.
 rented the sergeants that they would continue the digging with the workers until October (when the start of the mining period) and that they had been assigned to this task for an unlimited period from the start. Work was therefore carried out in Trinil from mid-June to mid-October in 1906, with three large trenches being carried out and further individual shafts being started. By and large, the order I issued and conveyed by Herr Volz was followed, "never to go down to the exact color and type of bone layer"; In isolated cases, bone material, mainly in somewhat higher elevations, has already been touched and stored, which is recorded in our collections with special figures from 1906, so that the subsequent control of the work at that time could be carried out sufficiently.

 II.
 News that was repeated orally in Europe afterwards prompted me to send a geologist out for the late summer months of 1906, which I intend to do if the work begun can be continued
 In November 1906 the geologist Dr. Johannes Elbert from Münster for the geological work and the Dutch mine engineer Fritz Oppenoorth for the technical management of the Trinil work. The latter took up the Heise on January 1, 1907, in order to start the preparatory work as early as the subsidence of the Begen monsoon would allow. At the beginning of February he arrived in Trinil and on his arrival found the sergeants and desires workers in Ngawi at his disposal. But he was not allowed to take the latter with him to Trinil as the house had to be built in accordance with regulations (with Freikulis)
 ).
 At this point I have to meet this reliable, talented and capable man (who at that
 1) Mr. Volz published the results of his geological observations made during that preliminary investigation in a brochure in the winter of 1906. I only became aware of the appearance of this publication shortly before I left for Java.
 2) Oppenoorth's own work report below provides information on the execution of this introductory and all other technical work.

 M. Lenore Selenka,
 performed his job as a volunteer for the first 4 months without any pecuniary remuneration), to express the most unreserved praise for his selfless, tireless zeal and excellent work. He deserves great credit for the success of the excavation work, which is so successful despite very special difficulties and obstacles.
 Unfortunately, Oppenoorth was unable to continue his work in Trinil until the end of the excavation period, as severe typhoid fever threw him on the sick bed in mid-August. After he had been fed by me for 3 weeks in his primitive trinile dwelling at his request in order not to be far from his beloved workplace, he had to be transferred to Ngawi.
 Not without heartfelt gratitude can I remember the generous behavior of the assistant-resident, Mr. Heckmeyer, who took the patient into his own home so as not to leave him to the military hospital. He gave him the most loving care for a full 4 months until a stage of convalescence made his return to Europe possible.
 Dr. Elbert went to Oppenoorth for two months and at the same time I started to leave the country. He arrived at the Triniler work site in mid-March, found the preparatory work led by Oppenoorth already in full swing and the living and working rooms set up.
 Dr. Elbert's activity in Trinil was limited to just under 3 months, since in mid-May, due to minor differences with Mr. Oppenoorth, he demanded that Mr. Oppenoorth be dismissed from me as a condition for the continuation of his contractually agreed work for 11 months. I could not possibly accept such a condition for more than one reason. At one point, Mr. Oppenoorth's involvement at that stage of the work seemed absolutely essential. Dr. Elbert himself, with whose knowledge and consent Oppenoorth was employed, had to confirm the excellence of his work. But then it would have been an unforgivable mistake, without the very best reasons, to dismiss the only Dutchman who was employed by this work on Dutch-Indian soil and with such extensive Dutch support. Under these circumstances, Dr. Elbert left the expedition in mid-June.
 After his departure, a geologist who happened to be in Java at the time, Dr. Deninger from Freiburg, working for the expedition in Trinil, but from their association already at the end
 June resigned.
 In mid-July, Dr. Emil Carthaus, then based in Tosari on Java, for the geological
 and palaeontological work in Trinil I did 1
 Since Dr. Elbert on his departure from Trinil, contrary to his obligation and promise

 the expedition as good as inconclusive 2
 to undertake all over again. (I also refer to his report below.)
 )
 Dr. Carthaus stayed with the expedition from the end of July 1907 until the end of the working period of that year; H. until the rainy season came and the most important bone layer, which was only about 20 cm above the depth of the river, came under water.

 When Mr. Oppenoorth fell ill towards the end of August, Dr. Carthaus also oversees the technical work as well as the sorting, preparation and recovery of the finds. I am Dr. Carthaus is very grateful for the great zeal and interest with which he has taken on the work that is in the middle of the process and made so difficult by the lack of the basics and brought it to a close. In the course of our collaboration, I was often astonished how this gentleman, who had lived in the tropics for so long, had accepted nothing at all of the slowness and nonchalance that one encountered so often in long-term tropical settlers, but rather the vivacity of the Had preserved spirit and initiative that have benefited the work greatly. I don't want to allow myself to judge the value of his work here, since she can speak for herself in this work.
 As an additional assistant, I hired Mr. Charles Boissevain, nephew of the chief government official of the Madiun residence, as secretary and bookkeeper. I want to give the young man the best possible appreciation for his loyalty to his duty in fulfilling the many tasks into which he knew how to work his way quickly. He also checked the found notes with the greatest conscientiousness and kept the lost property book.

 The island of Java is divided into 13 residences; each one of them has a resident over him who is endowed with extensive powers. The individual residencies break up again into districts, which, one might say, are governed by assistant residences; for this second rank also represents an authoritarian power in its area, and even the controllers subordinate to it, to which the smaller localities are subordinate, still have independent jurisdiction.
 The Madiun residence, to which Trinil belongs, is located in the very heart of Java - in the so-called Middenjava. Their area encloses two large volcanoes (the Lawu and Wilis), members of the
 ).
 The Madiun residence has long been known to the Javanese population as a place where bones were found. Many names in the vicinity of Trinil still point to this fact, such as Batu-Gadja (the elephant stone), as the cliffs are called a few minutes upstream from Trinil. (See Fig. 2 in Carthaus, Geologie von Java, p. 20.)
 The vernacular calls these remains butangbuta (bones of giants) and keeps the tradition alive that violent fights between gigantic demons once took place on these places. It is called u. a. that the head of such a giant lay at Surabaja and the feet at the western end of the island, while his body parts are scattered over the middle of the country. The Chinese settlers in the country, who are the only agents of trade in every fairly sizeable village, have known these sites since ancient times and used them for medicinal purposes

 used because here, as in China itself, the powder made from crushed fossil bones is used as a miracle-working medicine. <In any case, it would always be practical for the discovery of fossil sites if one wanted to investigate the sites that have been handed down among the Chinese.)
 In a less superstitious way, however, the Madiun bones were already being looked at around the middle of the last century by a Javanese gentleman named Raden-Saleh, who for scientific purposes brought together an impressive collection of fossil bones, which are now in the Geological Museum of Suffering is located. This man, highly developed for his time and environment, who also excelled as a painter, a scion of an old, elegant Javanese regent family with Arab admixtures, appears to be a belated descendant of the former heyday of Javanese cultural development, as it was under the influences of a millennium , more spiritual than political invasions from India into Java unfolded. One after the other, sometimes side by side, the waves of Brahmanism, Buddhism and Islam flooded the island and left their mark on the population, religious architecture, law, literature and science, blending with the original cultural heritage of the Malay islanders has created a characteristically self-contained cultural structure. Even today, Java's handicrafts are of a strictly individualized
 ized, sharply outlined, distinguished peculiarity that is unparalleled in the world. On the other hand, there is the tremendous boom in architecture and sculpture, of which the largest and most elaborate Buddhist monuments in the world still bear witness in this country, whose population today knows almost nothing about the technology of stone construction, and occasionally Regarding the images that appear in his rice fields as having fallen from heaven, they are quickly forgotten - just like the historical consciousness among the people
 seems dead and has its monuments only in the dramas and epics of national literature.
 It is only a century and a half ago since the last of the powerful empires in which that cultural period of Java found its highest political expression, the Muslim empire of Mataram in Middenjava - which, like the more western Hindu empire of Modjapahit, once had its sphere of power far beyond Java's borders in the Indian archipelago and as far as the Malay Peninsula - fell into two parts under contact with the Dutch, which then survived for almost a century in a kind of pseudo-life.

 Introduction.
 IX
 Areas of Java, the Empire of Surakarta and the Sultanate of Djokjakarta, the latter in close proximity to Madiun.
 In these districts, currently grouped under the name of the "Vorstenlande", the population still bears the most clearly
 Stamp of the mixture of blood between the established Malay tribe and the Aryan immigrants. The type of Javanese proper - as the population of Middenjava, especially the foothills, as well as Madiun and Kediri, in a broader sense also all of Eastern Java, is called - differs sharply from that of the coastal inhabitants and from the Sundanese, who are particularly represented in the western Javanese. The physique is slimmer and slimmer, the color of the face lighter, especially in the posh
 Great. The formation of the face is more noble than the Malay, and is often of an Aquiline type. In the costume, too, there is a difference in the tastier simplicity, the seriousness of the colors and the strict style of the arrangement of folds in the drapery, as in the characteristic binding of the headscarf.
 The Javanese stands out in front of the Sunda

 greater formality of nature, as well as even more
 more marked devotion in front of the traditionally superior and the Europeans. Also in the language, which, by the way, differs from ordinary Malay and not without it even from the Malays Fig. 3.
 If anything else is understood, there is an extraordinary awkwardness and strict constraint; here, as in the ancient Indian languages, there is still a differentiation of the use of words for the meaning of higher to lower and vice versa.
 Only in the foothills and in Middenjava can one still observe the custom, which is embarrassing for Europeans, that oncoming merrymakers or wagon drivers jump off in sight of the approaching European or even a tall Javanese and crouch down on the side of the road with their faces turned away until the Spectator is over. In Trinil, the messengers, suppliers, and even the chiefs of my person usually only approached in low

 At the two courts of Surakarta and Djokjakarta, the stiff ceremonial of the past brilliant times still prevails in almost unchanged form. It doesn't matter that both potentates are not much more than prisoners in their many kilometers of palace districts - the so-called kratons - and never without permission and only in the company of the Dutch resident

 are allowed to leave this district, which is sweetened for them by outwardly meticulous honors from the Dutch administration, as well as by very respectable annual payments. Within their district, however, they are unrestricted autocrats and the court of several thousands, as well as the vast Kraton population and, in a broader sense, the population of the entire area of ​​the foothills, live in direct dependence on "the nail of the universe," like one of the hundred titles of the Emperor of Surakarta is.
 How strictly the Dutch are able to maintain the appearance of the old conditions from the beginning of their political conquest in Java was brought to mind by a process that I was aware of on the way to Trinil in the hotel des 4 hours away by train Surakarta watched. On the side of the porch of the house I saw a procession of six Javanese, who are known as court servants, passing by from the kitchen. Two forerunners, then two, who carried a steaming silver soup bowl on raised hands and two rear ones, which held the characteristic gilded "pajung" (state umbrella) of imperial dignity stretched over it, which was also displayed at every departure of the prince, even over the The roof of the closed body is supported. Every day at 12 o'clock the "tribute" of the Dutch government is paid as an honorary
 testimony delivered to the imperial court.
 To illustrate the curious flowers that make up this Asian mix
 table pompes with European aspirations, here is another rehearsal. At a ceremonial reception of the Emperor of Surakarta, to which all the high-ranking Dutch officials of the place were invited along with their ladies, a whole column of barefoot servants in gold-braided liveries, who crept up in the usual, half-crawling posture,
 magnificent crystal goblets with beautifully chased heavy gold lids are presented. The habitues of the place thanked them negatively by bowing their heads, but I - a newcomer and half languished in the sultry

 The column of servants went out to the other side of the hall with their tantalus cups and came back after a few minutes, the goblets now filled with ice-cream lemonades, but without gold lids, which one should obviously admire beforehand, undisturbed by the sensual enjoyment of the refreshment drink.

 had monstrous giant cucumbers handed over. This dance is only performed by very young princesses of imperial blood and offers a spectacle of exquisite exotic grace and bizarre. The recordings, which I had to make crouching on the floor in front of the crouching musicians, were made quite difficult by the fact that I was not allowed to turn my back on the potentate enthroned in the background of the hall at any price, which was (Dutch- discher) Chief Ceremony Master had impressed very emphatically!
 Incidentally, among the younger generation of these strange courts one now encounters an up-and-coming trend, some representatives of it speak Dutch or even French, and the mixture of their traditional, artistic and elegant customs with Western manners produces very attractive results.

 Very recently the spirit of Reformation has begun to stir in Java as well, which, it seems, traces back to the Russo-Japanese war, seems to gradually bring the whole Eastern world, which has been rigid for so long, into more or less noticeable vibrations . Quietly pulsing there is a striving through the Javanese people to become more conscious of themselves again, less instinctively to regard the things around them as given. The old heroic national literature, breathed deeply by the Hindu spirit, after having been kept alive for centuries only by the popular wayang stage, is being revived for study. The ancient sacred Kawis J
 are brought out and made the basis of popular reform efforts. This is not the place to pursue this interesting Renaissance movement on Malay soil any further. I want to end this excursus into ethnological field, which is perhaps a bit forbidden here, with a strange prophecy, which I was told as coming from a secret Kawi manuscript of the 3rd century AD and which I am passing on without responsibility. It goes something like this: “There will come a time when people will walk on iron strings! And at that time, the people of Java are different
 To be subjugated to the people. And then there will come a time when people will go up in the air. And at that time the people of Java will become free again! "
 The religion of the population of Java is present throughout (if we disregard the Chinese colonies, which only make up a large number in the coastal places and exclusively comprise traders and craftsmen, and the diminishing number of Hindustan merchants and peddlers, here called "Kling") Islam, which is expressed in noisy festivals on the high Muslim holidays, but otherwise lets "Allah be a good man" and never grows to the fanaticism that often forms the soul of insurrectionary outbreaks on Sumatra and other islands of the archipelago .
 In addition, the Javanese brain teems with a myriad of genuinely native ghosts and demons, who give his strongly developed imagination the necessary nourishment.
 This lively imagination, together with great passion in an externally measured nature, a sensitivity that can be called almost sensitive, and a naive, violent feelings of honor, one has to bear heavily in the treatment of Javanese. The administrative officials exercising jurisdiction - as I have often observed - also put these character elements into the scales with great understanding, as is generally the case today (it used to be different) the thorough understanding and skillful handling of the Malay national character and the inherited customs aroused admiration on the part of the Dutch. Also only in Malay

 M. Lenore Selenka,
 The rampage that occurs in the archipelago and Malacca falls under this aspect. Even now one finds the ominous large wooden fork planted at the entrance of every larger patch, with which the man, seized by sudden frenzy, who was still responsible for peaceful work a few minutes before, is caught in his wild, dead straight, pernicious course of every oncoming, in order to be in silent custody Brought to consciousness, but not handed over to punishment. Likewise, the so-called "latah," a peculiar sporadic insanity, which only occurs in Malays, is probably connected with this extremely excitable disposition. It is mostly related to some kind of shock or strong emotional movement and manifests itself in the fact that the exciting object, for example a snake or a dog, is cramped for days, sometimes for weeks.
 In the case of the servants, thrown together from different areas of Java, which the housekeeping in Trinil required and which was difficult enough to keep together - for our primitive housekeeping in deserted places was with the spoiled terms especially the "Jongen" taken from the coast as "Bimbu" (wilderness) decried - have I made or studied all kinds of studies on the Javanese psyche. be able to renew previous experiences in it.
 The large number of these servants in European terms is explained by the box-like limitation of their services. The water carrier will not cut grass, the messenger will not do house service, etc. There were always some parasitic appendages to take with you in order to get people in our remote area; especially since the important post of Kokki (cook) could usually not be filled without an officially recognized "accompanying phenomenon" and unfortunately, given the ephemeral nature of the latter, it was subject to frequent changes. The Javans, as Mohammedans, are polygamists, but on average they make little use of it or at least more in the form of succession, a divorce still costs a few guilders less than a marriage.
 Unfortunately, I could not make use of the rich material on psychological observation that the convict workers assigned to me would have offered, because the consideration of the criminal relationship forbade any closer examination of the people or any involvement with them outside of working hours.

 The Madiun area is the hottest area on the island in terms of climate. It has the honorary title "Hell of Java" in Dutch vernacular. In Trinil the thermometer moved on average in the cooler summer months (between 92-95 ° Fahrenheit = 34 ° C.). In September and October, when the heat rises, we often had 100 ° F. (== 38 ° C.) and more.
 Trinil has not been an actual town for a long time and until recently was not even listed on the government maps of Java: it now consists of only 3-4 poor huts.
 The next somewhat larger settlement is Soko, where besides Malay there was only one European family (of Mr. Lukas). Because of the kindness of this gentleman, we have been able to enjoy the advantages of a daily supply of fresh bread, milk and ice cream.
 About 15 km away is the next more respectable place, namely Ngawi, the seat of an assistant resident and a controller, as well as a small garrison. Before we began our work, the way from the great highway on which Ngawi is to Trinil was completely impassable for cars; In view of our company, the courteous government officials made it more or less drivable for narrow-gauge cars, but every downpour and other coincidences often caused unpleasant interruptions to our connection.
 The nearest train station to Trinil, about 18 km away, on the line crossing the island from east to west, which was only completed a few years ago, is Paron and the distance from here is 9 hours to Surabaja and 24 hours to Batavia. (There are no night trips.)
 The Pithecanthropus funesial (see Fig. 1 on plate I) is on the left bank of Solo at a sharp corner of the river; a flat plate-like projection pushes itself into the river bed,
 On the side of the Solo River opposite the site of the Pithecanthropits Resie, on the edge of the steeply sloping, approximately 50 m high river slope, Dubois left a low memorial stone on which the letters PAE [Pithecanthropus erectus) are carved and an arrow pointing to the on the other bank indicates the point at which the find was made. (The number of meters given as the distance is not entirely correct.) Dr. At my request, Carthaus made a trigonometric fixation of the site and marked the location precisely. The Solo River makes a north-facing loop that breaks up into many smaller turns, the base of which narrows to only 500 m south of Trinil 2
 ).
 Plate I gives two views of the site taken in August 1907. The raised heaps of the ledge are later embankments, originating from the overburden of the hinterland that we removed. The specific location of the femur is on plate I, Fig. 1 in front of the open hut with a lying white cross, in plate I, Fig. 2 by a white paper lying on the floor, that of the skull in the latter figure by a poster low pillar next to the open shed. The two posts were made by us according to the statements made by the person employed under Dubois

 which originally rose only a little above the lowest water level (see Fig. 6) 1).
 the workers of Dubois found the skull and about 1 year later the femur of Pithecanthropus about 15 m away, and in the following years 2 teeth a short distance away.

 When he left Java, Dubois had planted three small casuarina trees near the memorial stone; We found these shot up to an impressive height (see Fig. 7 above). They were the only tree representatives on the otherwise completely bare river plateau, on which we built our houses with full view of the workplace.
 The space for these houses with the outbuildings was rather limited, as it was approached to the north by the Dussois Pit, to the south, by a rather deep gorge.

 To the south of our home rose the regular, truncated cone of the volcano? Lawu, which we only saw in the clear early morning hours and shortly before sunset stand out sharply against the sky. We were therefore unable to take a good photograph from here of this volcano, which is closest to our place of work, which seems to be so closely related to the bone deposits in Trinil, because there is too little light at those hours. Even the faint outline of the Wilis volcano was sometimes visible to the northeast in particularly favorable weather conditions. The low one ran between them as a blue haze line
 The Pandan range of hills, the so-called Kendeng Mountains, which only reach a height of approx. 150m. The surrounding area was pretty bare. Rice was not cultivated in the area, there were only a few tobacco fields, some of which we found at very low prices in late summer

 bought in order to examine new excavation terrain. The only larger tree population was, a few kilometers away, one of those characteristic Djati forests, whose species of tree, with its extraordinary hardness of wood, provides the material for the most important wooden implements and tools and which, despite the dense stand, provide little shade because the very large leaves in grow too far apart.
 In the immediate vicinity there was only sparse bush on the river banks. In a sense, this was a favorable circumstance, since even from this sparse population we had to chop off the bushes that towered over the edge of the plateau towards autumn, because they offered the poisonous snakes, which increased in size and brazenly at the first signs of the time, which became ever more brazen of the

 Area are numerous, welcome hiding spots from which they could easily reach our veranda, their favorite sleeping place, at night. These beptiles were always in the spaces between our braided double walls. At noon we were often frightened by the frightened squeaking of the frogs at which they were eating at the same time as ours. Chasing away would only have been possible if our house had been demolished.
 In addition, the great lack of animals in the whole area was striking. We saw no noteworthy representatives there, neither of smaller mammals nor of birds. Only around noon did we sometimes enjoy the sight of a slumbering crocodile, which made itself comfortable on the banks that were exposed in the dry season.
 In our immediate vicinity there was almost no food available; We could rarely even get rice. The only thing that we could get on the spot in favorable cases were fish, in which the river is very rich. But this also depended on the good XVI
 M. Lenore Selenka,
 Will of the fishermen who came together from a fairly wide area at regular intervals at the favorable river corner of Trinil, where they poisoned the river according to the Malay fishing method and then caught the stunned fish partly with small nets, partly with poles.
 A picture of this painting process is shown in Fig. 9. Striking enough the carelessness with which the people moved in the river, in spite of the not uncommon occurrence of crocodiles. So with our purchases of food, we were entirely dependent on deliveries from Ngawi

In order to be there in time, we had to send a prau (clumsy Malay river barge) with four men downriver to Ngawi the evening before, where they arrived early in the morning. With the supplies they acquired there, they hit because the journey home was

The kind wife of the assistant resident of Ngawi, Ms. Heck.meyeu, to whom I owe the warmest thanks in every respect, as well as her husband, has been very helpful to us with these difficult supply relationships. It is not too much to say that the unwavering willingness to help of this high-minded and kind-hearted man, often associated with great sacrifices of time and effort, and the rare understanding and interest that he showed in the scientific goals of the excavations, played a large part in the the implementation of the Trinil work.

 We owe the fact that the number of 25 detainees initially approved by the government was doubled in the second month and finally increased to 75. It goes without saying that that increase in the number of workers has been a major influence on the outcome of our labor.
 The government workers, who are also called chain boys there, because as convicts on the marches they are usually tied to one another with chains or, like ours, with ropes, were for the most part real Javanese from the residences of Central Java, and also from the Sundanese from the coastal areas Maduresen, from the neighboring island of Madura to the northeast. The latter made our most capable workers. They are considered to be the most spirited elements of the Malay population

 Java's approach, but at the same time as addicted to trading and idiosyncratic. They usually included the few murderers who were in our otherwise very tame column of criminals, and these were not the most clumsy for all work that required a little more intelligence. Most of the others were serving sentences for minor theft, jealousy and similar offenses.
 The rules for treating people were very precisely regulated. Beatings were strictly forbidden, and government officials immediately investigated any complaints made by workers. It was also strictly forbidden to let the workers transport heavy loads over long distances, and therefore we only had pieces of machinery or rails moved by people between nearby locations as an exception and with special permission.
 According to the official requirement, I had to build a sleeping house for the workers
 about 10 minutes away from our apartments. This workers' house had to come along

 be surrounded by a strong barbed wire fence to prevent the convicts from running away at night. Nevertheless, it happened a few times. Especially since the lazy Javanese found the stay in the prison in Ngawi at times more tempting than the arduous mine work.
 The people slept on bamboo beds, 4 or 6 together, all in a common room. Twice, in accordance with the increased number of workers, we had to add additional extensions to our prison house.
 The mandurs (Malay guards) assigned to them were not convicts, but mostly residents of the village of Ngawi. Among them were some very intelligent people who after a short time proved to be very skilled and reliable in treating the bones still stuck in the ground and in quickly recognizing such pieces in the surrounding earth.
 We also had some extremely skilled individuals among the workers themselves, whom we were able to train in preparation work, gluing and sorting of the finds. We met some of the people with real interest in the work; in any case, the ambition to have made a good find was evident in most of them.

 The convict costume consisted of short, brown-yellow jackets and trousers (the former were usually taken off at work) and a roof-shaped, coarsely braided grass hoof (as opposed to the traditional sarong costume in the country).
 Fig. 10 gives a picture of our column of workers as they come up from the bank at the end of their work in order to bring their equipment into the shed. The two men in the foreground with hats in hand are the manduras.
 The mood of the people was, on the average, by no means sullen, which I could observe especially during the daily bath. For every evening, when the troop of workers who worked in the other side of the pit, made multiple trips across the river on the flat Prau, the people romped about in the shallow yellow water with happy shouts, but more Asian

 Correspondingly, never took the loud forms as would be the case with similar amusements in Europe.
 The workers' meals were given twice a week by the Chinese "Ahemer," d. H. the delivery counterpart of the military authorities, drove on a cart to Trinil, where we always had to check the rations, weighed exactly for each head, with the greatest accuracy, so that fraud on the part of the Chinese would be prevented.
 The ration per capita was: 0.75 kg rice, 0.15 kg salt, 0.02 kg Javanese sugar, 0.2 kg fresh meat, 0.25 kg fresh or 0.1 kg dried fish, 0.25 kg fresh Vegetables and spanish pepper; often eggs instead of meat. Four of the people did the cooking themselves.
 The Indian government provided me with two active Dutch military men to supervise the workers, one with the rank of sergeant major, named Meyboom, a Dutchman by birth, the other a sergeant named Bauer, a German.
 For the period of 18 months for which they were available to me (instead of the 15 months originally granted to me), in addition to their regular military pay, these people received a total of 3 guilders daily from the government, so that the daily Salary payment amounted to 8 guilders. I emphasize this point in order to properly emphasize the generous support that the Indian government has given the work.
 The sergeants kept their own household in their little house, which was divided into two parts, where the Njai (Javanese housekeeper) they carried with them did the same for each of them.
 Fig. 11 shows the sergeant's apartment, an idyll in which the new citizen of the world born in Trinil, whose arrival we celebrated with the only available bottle of champagne, is not missing. (I understand that Sergeant Bauer recently brought the mother of this Trinil offspring home by marriage.)
 For the excellent choice of these two people, whose efficiency, reliability, zeal and intelligence I would like to express well-deserved praise at this point, I am particularly indebted to the Commander-in-Chief of the Javanese genius, Colonel deVoogd. In the one and a half year training course for the Trinil Workers, they have trained themselves to be highly valued assistants for such tasks that require responsibility and skill.
 The supervision of the workers was rather strict. The doors of her apartment were locked at night; two police officers kept watch; this guard was again checked by the village patrol. Such patrols can be found in all Javanese villages. After breakfast, the workers were brought to our apartment at 6 o'clock in the morning under the guidance of their mandates, where the two European overseers and Mr. Oppenoorth then checked whether everyone was present; then the sick were examined and helped if possible; if we could not treat them, they were sent back to Ngawi. When the inspection was over, the equipment was fetched from the Gudang and each overseer went with his group to the pits; one group of workers was put on a prau in two sections on the other bank. From 11 am to 1 am they rested and ate lunch. The work was then continued until 5 o'clock, the equipment was salvaged, and the evening bath in the river followed, whereupon the prison laborers were counted again. Then they were locked up again.
 Around the middle of working hours, at the beginning of August, we gave our workers' corps a customary »slamatan«, a kind of obligatory festival of happiness that is essential to the success of any job in Javanese terms. Our convicts and coolies got an afternoon off and were treated in a solenner manner on the grassy areas behind our apartments with two goats roasted in toto and unmeasured quantities of rice. This was enough to get the poor guys in

 M. Lenore Selenka,
 bright cheers. Unfortunately I had to deny them the joy of "tandakken" they had asked for. H. that they were allowed to enjoy the dance of some Malay country dancers; This process is very well mannered and respectful, especially since, according to Malay custom, women and men never dance together. But in the last moment I was held back from this encore by a wink from above. The people compensated for this by riding on painted hobby horses, an ancient pastime that they performed with much ceremony and dignity. One of the mandurs then gave a solemn address to the "Nonja besar derri Trinil" (great mistress of Trinil), as I was called in the area, in which he said that they enjoyed working for us and were happy, if a lot and really big (!) bones came out of the earth. The Kapala Kampongs (village heads) and their followers from all the villages in the vicinity had gathered for this festival, so that a very impressive gathering was gathered.
 The workers were very receptive to a small gift, mostly tobacco. Such gifts were given when a worker had brought out a fine fossil without damaging it, or when, as was initially the case, a great deal of ground had been processed. Fundamentally, however, monetary gifts or bonuses were never given for the raising of a fossil, so as not to mislead people in any way into frauds, which, of course, were ruled out both by the nature of the finds and that of our workers' material as well as by the incessant strict control.
 Besides the government workers, we employed 25-30 recruited coolies for most of the time, so that we worked with an average of 100 men; our sergeants, however, in some respects preferred the work of the penal laborers to that of the free coolies.
 V.
 The reports and treatises of my employees provide information on the division and implementation of the actual excavation work, the geological investigations and the findings. I limit myself to a few general information.
 The goal and the guiding thought that had determined me to begin these investigations was to determine the age of the Pithecanthropus layers more precisely by clarifying the geological conditions in general, as well as the overall picture of the fauna accompanying the Pithecanthropus remains, as well as possible Finding further remnants or related forms through which the still open question of the special position of this important intermediate form in the line of development of the human family tree could be further promoted.
 In addition, the finding of early human remains and traces should be investigated, as far as the scope of the expedition somehow allowed.
 The fact that, apart from the specific developmental results, the excavation of a rich vertebrate fauna was to be expected in this program, which in addition to its importance for the elucidation of age, also promised special scientific and materially valuable results, was to be assumed based on previous experience and had a decisive effect on them Participation of the academic anniversary foundation in my company.
 
  Introduction.
 XXI
 Since it was established and confirmed by our preliminary investigation in 1906 that the Trinile soil itself was still very rich in fossils, also the fact that the individual remains of Pitheeanthropus were found in fairly close proximity to one another, the expectation that more would be found If parts of the same individual did not appear too bold, the exploitation of the immediate vicinity of that site was placed at the center of the overall work. We therefore begin our excavations on both banks of the Solo River, following on from the sites excavated at the time of the Dubois. We began first with attacking the right bank of the river and with Expansion of the trenches created in 1906 (Pit I). The water conditions as well as the lower number of our workers at the beginning made it possible for us to open the actual Pithecanthropus SteWe on the left bank only towards the end of May (pit II cf. plate I). From then on there was continuous work on both banks until the end of the expedition. This conclusion only took place with the again somewhat abnormally early onset of the rainy season in the last days of October 1907 and the associated complete underwater stepping of the bone beds.
 After the direct excavation and recovery work was completed, about 10 days were used to pack and send the last found objects, to clean and repair the borrowed machines, rails, bulk trucks and tools and to transport the latter material back to Ngawi, so that the final conclusion the expedition took place around mid-November 1
 ).
 The work in Trinil itself was always the focus of the task according to the goals set for the expedition. In the second half of the 1907 working period, however, smaller detachments of workers with the necessary supervision were sent to investigate and prospecting work in the near and far area of ​​Trinil. Longer examinations were also carried out in the pandan chain (the low ridge south of Trinil) and in the adjacent volcanoes Lawu and Wilis. Work on a larger scale at a great distance from Trinil could not be carried out with the workers granted by the government, since they were not allowed to be employed at any significant distance from Trinil, while other workers were allowed to be employed in larger ones
 Number could not be obtained at the relevant locations. All investigations further away from Trinil therefore had to be carried out with smaller troops of recruited coolies.
 During such a small expedition to the wider area of ​​Trinil, the fossil human tooth was also found, that of the Berlin Anthropological Society in the February 1910 meeting
 was presented for discussion and to Prof. Walkhoff and
 ).
 The place where the tooth was found at the edge of the small Sondebach, a tributary of the Bengawan, is 3.5 km from Trinil.
 In its upper course, the Sondebach washes the bones of Alas-tua, in which fossils corresponding to the Trinil fauna are found. Individual bone finds have also been made in the vicinity of the mouth.

  XXII M. Lenore Selenka,
 It goes without saying that both in 1907 and in the second year of work we carried out extensive searches for other human finds in the vicinity of the site, but unfortunately without any result.
 We sent the finds to Germany with the German-Australian Shipping Line, as the only line that could transport the boxes without reloading in Singapore. Although we had been granted free shipping for 20 cbm on the North German Lloyd and the discount granted on the Australian line was considerably lower, we preferred not to subject the contents of the crates, which were easily endangered by impact, to double loading. The boxes were transported to Surabuja and embarked there on the customary ox wagon to the next train station.
 Fig. 12.
 The place where the human tooth was found in the Sondö Valley. (Photograph by Dozy.)
 We sent the first shipment, consisting of 17 large boxes, at the end of August, and two more shipments in September and November. The total shipment for 1907 consisted of 43 large boxes.
 The collections have become the property of the Berlin Palaeontological Museum.
 At the end of the work, the expedition houses were placed under the care of the assistant resident of Ngawi and, despite their light construction and the heavy rain monsoon in winter, remained sufficiently well-maintained to serve as apartments for the next year's working period, in 1908.
 Before leaving Java, I asked His Excellency the Governor of the Dutch East Indies for permission to continue the excavations in the following year, if the means could be found. Before I left I received the grant on the condition that the Work would be started by August 1908 at the latest.
 
  XXIII
 In spring 1908, at the suggestion of Dr. Schlosser, the curator of the Munich State Palaeontological Collection, the management of this museum is close to the plan to financially support the continuation of the Trinil work, which I am granted by my previous license. For the new working period, I got the Dutch mine engineer Mr. Charles Maria Dozy, a friend of my previous Dutch colleague Oppenoorth, approved by the Munich museum directorate and inaugurated all the details of the work by Oppenoorth himself.
 Mr. Dozy went to Java at the beginning of July 1908 and started the excavations there again with the help of the 25 workers already sent to the site by the Indian government. As a result of more favorable weather conditions than had prevailed in the previous year, these were continued until mid-December 1909 with again very rich findings. This year, too, my representative was given 25 freelancers (at the very end even 50) over and above the original number; the same benefits were also granted to the company this year in terms of transport, procurement of machines, pumps, etc.
 The successor to Mr. van Rees at that time, General Secretary Mr. Van der Oorth, as well as the I. Secretary Mr. Hulshoff Pol, and we also have the current assistant resident of Ngawi Mr. Mulder and the commanding officer Thank you Mr. Landshoek for your willing support.
 Mr. Dozy got rid of his difficult and responsible task with extraordinary skill and great loyalty to his duties, which is all the more commendable as he took on this task immediately after graduating from the Dordrecht technical college. Based on the work of the previous year and the aids still available from it, in the short five months of his work in Trinil he has created a very respectable and excellently organized collection and provided a series of profiles and records that complement the work of the previous year. I give unreserved recognition to the capable young man in my name and in the name of the Directory of the Munich State Paleontological Collection.
 The findings of the two-year working period have passed into the possession of the Royal Bavarian State Geological-Paleontological Collection, whose board of directors has kindly allowed them to be used for joint processing with the Berlin collection; it therefore forms the basis of the specialist work in this work.
 The excavations on Java took a total of 18 months according to what has been said:
 in 1906 from mid-June to mid-October,
 »» 1907 »February 1st to November 13th,
 »» 1908 »August 1 to mid-December.
 From this time eleven months were devoted to research into the actual bone layers, while approx. 7 months (including the period from 1906) were taken up by the extensive preparatory work.
 An average of 8 to 12 meters of mostly hard upper layers had to be lifted off before the bone layers were reached. The total earthmoving carried out in the 3 working periods is around 10,000 cubic meters.
 Introduction.

 M Lenore Selenka, -
 The riddle of Pühecanthropus has not yet been finally solved. The Trinil expedition did not produce any new evidence of direct membership or non-membership in the human family tree. On the other hand, the question of the age of the strata of his finds, which is significant for his position on the history of human development, has been clarified in one most important point.
 It does not matter whether one or the other of the narrower views on age represented in this work - or published in some other way, but gained on the basis of a connection with the expedition - (after all, even with the inclusion of Dubois' view, they only diverge within half of a relatively short geological time period), that much is certain now: The decisive layers of the find are geologically younger than was previously largely assumed. So you are too young to be able to recover a form that was still directly active in the human developmental trunk at that time, that is, a form that actually preceded the incarnation at that time.
 For it can be described as a generally prevailing assumption of today's research that man in no way came into being on or even after the transition from the tertiary to the diluvium, which is now more or less just a matter of. It is one of the results of the Trinil expedition that it was able to prove, with great probability, traces of real people on Java as local and contemporaries of Pühecanthropus.
 If, therefore, one wants to see a direct human ancestry in Pühecanthropus at a certain stage of development and not rather regard it as the offspring of a developmental branch branched off laterally from the same trunk in the early Tertiary, one must logically assume that the geological form Pühecanthropus was already early existed in the tertiary and then, after somehow and at some point man emerged from it, it persisted alongside the higher form developed from it as an old residual form and without further lateral specialization into the Diluvium.
 It can be countered whether such a long persistence of the form overtaken by development and no longer specializing is probable. We do have examples of other species of mammals that have survived from the Middle Tertiary to the present day with almost no transformation. But whether such an analogy could also be applied to the most complicated case of a being as highly developed as Pühecanthropus is another question!
 In itself, however, the question would be justified and the finding of a single individual of Pühecanthropus in the old Diluvial or even the most recent Tertiary should not justify us to draw the time limit downwards so narrowly for him that he is therefore out of the direct tribal human line would have to be switched off for reasons of time. With the age determination of the Trinile strata, the question - which would have been simplified by the result of a decidedly tertiary age of the same - is no longer resolved. In addition to the geological aspects, the morphological aspects will have to come to the fore again, and this indisputably requires further discoveries and, in order to obtain them, further systematic research.
 In Pühecanthropus, whether we see him in the direct line of the tribe or on a side branch of the human tribe, we still have the closest relative of the human being, whom we have known up to now, so close that the boundary line to the genuine, lowest human being becomes according to some eminent researchers, it is now almost beginning to blur.
 It therefore remains one of the most burning tasks of anthropological development research to fathom its secret further.
 
  Introduction. XXV
 It is at least probable that the soil of Java, which can be called classical in this sense, can hold the key to it - and perhaps to some other new information about the earliest epochs of the human race - and the incarnation - in its bosom.
 It would probably only be a question of sufficient time, means and perseverance to wrest rich developmental and anthropological treasures from it, especially if one also draws the absolutely tertiary terrestrial stratification more into the investigations.
 But the stubborn coincidence just a few meters from the floe, where our expedition made the last shovel stab, could easily give us the same Pithecanthropus individual, previously known to be all too problematic, who conjured up this flood of hypotheses - and in all probability near the place where he was found only disintegrated into its parts - giving an arm or jawbone, which would be so incomparably important for the evolutionary decision.
 A complete search of this entire deposit, which has now been approximately determined by our expedition and is not excessively extensive, would not be too great a sacrifice for such a chance.
 Having tackled the big problem at this auspicious point with an almost intuitive grip will remain the permanent and lasting merit of Eugen Dubois. The Trinil expedition only wanted and could be a continuation on this foundation. Perhaps one of her most valuable results is that she has restarted research that has been dormant for almost 20 years.
 To my delight, I can express my reasonable expectation that the Dutch-Indian government, stimulated by the results of this expedition, will soon start the commencement and continuation of the investigations on Java.
 In conclusion, I take the opportunity to express my sincere thanks to all of the gentlemen who worked on this work; but especially to my co-editor, Professor Dr. Max BLANCKENHORN-Berlin, for his tireless and self-sacrificing work in creating this work.

 Mine engineer F. Oppenoorth.

 •
 On January 1, 1907, I embarked in Genoa and, after a short stay in Batavia, reached Trinil towards the end of January.
 Since Trinil itself only consists of a few Malaysian huts and therefore offered no accommodation, I first had to quarter in Ngawi, from where I immediately started the construction of the necessary buildings.
 The location of the expedition houses was determined by the local conditions. We chose an approx. 100 m wide plateau protruding into a river corner and bordered by two brook gorges, which allowed a free overview of the two nearest turns of the Solo River, which is strongly curved here, and of the site of the Pithecanthropits remains. On the edge of this plateau was the memorial stone 1 erected by Dubois
 ).
 From here we were able to keep an eye on the two main points where our excavations were to begin.
 I found the column of 25 forced laborers assigned to the SELEXKA expedition together with 2 European overseers (sergeants) already available when we arrived in Ngawi, but I was not allowed to transfer them to Trinil before the house for them was completed and with the obligatory barbed wire fence (as an interim prison) was set up.
 I therefore had to build this house and a temporary apartment for myself with recruited freelancers (coolies).
 We paid these people 30 cents a day (about half a mark), which is a lot for this area. Even so, the workforce was hard to come by. Almost all the men were busy with the work on the paddle fields (rice fields), and this explains why the preparatory work took up a lot of time. The procurement of building material also cost us a lot of effort. Any material other than bamboo was very difficult to come by, despite being very close to the Djati forests. These forests are under government supervision and the timber sales are leased. There are only a few places where there is a store of wood where you can buy it. In addition, you have to have a permit to transport wood.

 which is only valid for a few days. Transporting timber without such a permit will result in a prison sentence. So it was much more convenient, faster and cheaper for us to use bamboo, a material that every Javane possesses in sufficient quantities. This giant grass, which grows in clusters of 10 to 100 stalks and is up to 30 m high, gives the Javanese everything that belongs to building a house. He also uses it to build his bridges and make his household appliances from them, and the young root shoots, preserved in vinegar, make an excellent treat. There are different types of bamboo:
 1. Bamboo peton, which is as thick as a strong pine tree. We couldn't get this variety in Trinil.
 2. Bamboo ori, about 10 cm in diameter, which we used as supports and beams.
 3. Bamboo-Alus (fine bamboo) in the thickness of 3 to 5 cm. This was split into 8 parts, the outer bark removed and
 braided together. Such
 Wattle was used too
 House walls, also for carrying baskets, mats, etc.
 For roofing was
 Alang-Alang taken, an approx. 1 m
 tall grass that is about 20 cm
 thickly on top of each other and
 excellent protection against the heat
 and the tropical rain. At
 This grass wasn't catching either
 to get only several hundred
 Roof tiles were to be found; we
 then have a few thousand themselves
 burned. For this purpose a small, round oven used that is about
 2 m in diameter and with
 Wood waste was heated. That such
 Bricks, on bamboo rafters
 placed, definitely not against tropical
 rain give a completely protective roof, we have learned several times. Later these tile roofs were also covered with Alang-Alang.
 We had to build 8 buildings in all: 1 dwelling house, 1 laboratory, 1 storage room, 1 kitchen house with servants 'apartment and bathroom, 1 stable and carriage room, 1 house for the sergeants, 1 very large workers' house, 1 shed for equipment and machines.
 Fig. 13 is a view of one of our cottages, built on the model of the native dwellings, only slightly higher and more comfortable. It contained our laboratory and the dissecting room. At the back left is the gudang (storage room) for the bones, in which our darkroom was also set up.
 Fig. 14 shows the house under construction. One is busy with making the roof, i. H. to lay the rafters on it. The floor consisted of tamped clay with sand and after a few days it became quite hard. The house contained 6 rooms and was 6 m high. It took a lot of effort to get bamboo that was both long and strong

 was enough. Walls, doors, and shutters were all made of bamboo wickerwork; Of course we didn't have glass windows. Fig. 15 gives a view of the finished house. The vertical bamboos were coated with tar to protect them from the white ants and planted about 2 m / 2 m deep into the earth. We were here quite high and on dry sandy ground, so that the houses did not have to stand on stilts, as is the custom in Java.
 Fig. 16 provides an overall picture of our eight houses, taken from the river bank, with the exception of the workers' house, which was further away. The river is just visible below to the right. In the foreground under the Dubois memorial is the fountain, on the right a narrow footpath leads to pit I. In the background is the Kendeng hill range.
 One of our first jobs was, of course, to provide drinking water, an extremely difficult thing with the sudden gathering of such a large number of drinking water
 poor places. We were able to get the river water mostly from a fountain, but since we usually have to bathe in it, we always have to give the water in the dry season, as was the case when we were about
 definitely not to drink. All sorts of sick people have to fetch water, filter it and cook very well. The wells no longer have abundant water 100 in number, our residence in Trinil
 took. There were too many people for the well, and as a result we were not able to get any drinking or ground water several times in the beginning. So we had to try to drill a new well ourselves, which happened in the gorge south of the memorial stone. We were given a small drill rig from the Dutch-Indian Mining System, similar to the one used in Banka for drilling tin ore. At a depth of about 6 m we found pretty good water. To a
 Fig. 14.
 The house under construction.
 To get a sufficient amount, we dug a hole about 1 m in diameter at this point, which was lined with bamboo wickerwork at the bottom.
 We strictly forbade the workers to fetch water here; they got their own well, which was drilled near their place of work and their home.
 At the beginning of March 1907 we had come to the point where apartments were ready for myself and 25 workers. Later an apartment had to be built for the two overseers near the river bank. Now it was also possible to bring the tools and machine material necessary for the excavations to Trinil. Some of this material was already stored in Ngawi and was sent in a grobak (transport cart, pulled by oxen) to Soko, the very small village located at first in Trinil. The last stretch of car from there was not passable during the rainy season. The heavy downpours made the ground softened, so that everything from Soko to Trinil had to be carried 4 km. During our stay, the ground and the path became a little harder, so that we could later drive a car, but it is several times happens that the car couldn't go any further and we had to ask the villagers to help us. It was always done willingly.
 That has more trouble for us
 Transport of large pieces of material
 made, such as pumps, drills and
 the Decauvillebahn material. Also
 these could go to Soko by car
 to be brought. When the water
 was high enough, they were turned into a
 Prau (small boat) loaded and such
 the Soko River (tributary of the Solo)
 promoted down to Trinil. However, this was not always possible because the small tributaries do not carry water at all times. The rather heavy Decauville wagons were then pulled to Trinil by about 10 workers. The wagons often sank into the wet clay right up to the axles, and it took many hours to get to work. Rail sections from un-
 2 people could carry about 5 m in length. The pumps (the well-known diaphragm pumps) also made little effort because they could be completely dismantled.
 The excavation work began at a point which we knew from the previous summer's excavations that there were fossil bones, namely on the right bank of the Solo, at the gorge north of the memorial stone.
 As already reported elsewhere, in 1906 from the beginning of July to mid-October 20 men had worked ahead and the following digs had been made
 . *
 1. On the right bank of the river about 60 m south of the memorial stone, directly on the river, there was a hole of such dimensions that two men could work in it. It was deepened to 2 m below the lowest water level. It was impossible to go deeper because of the strong water pressure. The drilled layer, a black, crumbly clay containing Melania, continued a little further down. The bone layer

 Divisions dug and only the northern one down to the bone layer. This was the piece that was started and some bones were found in it, so a subsequent part was started. Fortunately, the latter was not completed to the bone layer, so that we could dissect the bones ourselves next year. Among the fossils found in 1906 was a fairly well-preserved skull of a Felis species, several bones from Cervus, Bos, and Stegodon, including a Stegodon skull that is said to have been about 80 cm high, but unfortunately fell apart completely.
 3. On the left bank of Solo, directly on the river, about 50 m south of the last Dubois excavation. The breadth was about two meters and the depth was about four feet below the lowest water level. Some bones were also found here as early as 1906.
 4. On the left bank of Solo, dug into the river wall, a few hundred meters north of the
 Dussois excavations. The depth was 1 l / - m below the lowest water level. It was 2
 found black clay and a 0.35 m thick layer of bone with some stegodon bones.
 Since some of the pits were right here on the river bank and the embankments that had been left could not withstand, these pits were flooded with mud in the winter of 1906-07, and therefore for
 Initially useless for observation purposes.
 In March 1907 I began to cover the terrain with about 12 men and lay the Decauville railway. For the time being, the rest of the workers were still occupied with the extension to the workers' house, which we had to build as quickly as possible to accommodate the 25 workers promised to me by the government.
 Because of the exceptionally high flood level, which we also had to struggle with now, in the spring of 1907, and the continuous heavy rainfall, mining had to be limited to the upper layers for the first month and a half. Nonetheless, the work site was once under water as a result of a heavy rain banjer (sudden enormous influx of water from the mountains after heavy rain squalls, which often causes large floods. ”Early in May we found we came to work early one morning The ditch several meters deep was completely submerged. Fortunately the D-amm had held out and the water level dropped again the next afternoon so we could start working with the pumps. Our government-supplied pumps would not have been sufficient But a short time beforehand we had removed from the one day ride But even during the entire duration of the east monsoon, the water conditions caused us the greatest difficulties. The inflow of groundwater was always so strong that we were only able to keep the pits sufficiently water-free by keeping all the pumps in constant action even in the driest months, mostly dew and night. (The pumps had a capacity of 1500 liters per minute.) The pumping could only be done by very strong workers who worked in two groups and had to be relieved every half hour Convicts could not be conducted enough control. The night pumper had to announce their vigilance by singing to the night watch on the residential bank.
 The following photographs show how colossal the water level in the Solo River is:
 Photograph 17 was taken on February 20th, in the middle of the rainy season; it is still densely the maximum level, but on the days on which this was noticeable, it rained so

To the right you can see the steep walls of the old excavations. The flat contour line in the background is the valley terrace of the river.

 Photograph 19 gives a picture of the lowest water level we experienced in Trinil; It was on August 29th. In the foreground are the three heaps of mine. The island of Fig. 17 protrudes entirely from the river; to the right of it you can see the whole of pit II. In the background, where a guard is standing in the water, is an experimental trench from 1906, which is now being enlarged a little. The river is now largely inaccessible.
 At the beginning of April the house for the new 25 forced laborers was ready, and dismantling could now be carried out on a large scale.
 Immediately next to the former Dubois excavation sites on the right bank, we began to enlarge the previous year's digs (I). In order to be able to dig the surface layer more quickly, a Decauville railway was laid after the river bank and the dead material was thrown onto a dump on the river. This saved a lot of time and effort, otherwise all loose ground would have had to be carried away with small carrying baskets, whereby it should be noted that the Javanese workers always take it for a walk, lose half the contents of the basket on the way and so on a lot of material

 Digging was also started on the left bank of the Solo, where the bone layer was partially washed away and a beautiful skull of Bos could be seen protruding.

 The pits were dug up in layers so that as many workers as possible could work at the same time without running the risk of an accident due to landslides or that too much land would be in vain if it turned out that the fossil record was declining or ceasing entirely. The Decauville Railway, on which the material was continued, was halfway up.
 In mid-April all the pumps were set up so that we could empty the hole from the previous year and remove the washed-in mud. About a month later we encountered the first layer of leaves and were able to collect leaf prints. Also were

 A few fossil bones had already been found in the upper layers of the sand, admittedly very isolated: they mainly belonged to Bos and Stegodon. Our "very first find was already at the beginning of April", but not exactly of the kind we were looking for, namely the complete skeleton of a recent Kerabau (buffalo) or large, gray Javanese tie! We used it for comparison purposes.
 The illustrations on plate III give a clear picture of the progress of work in the

 Fig. 1 shows the pit taken on April 1st, facing north. A bamboo bridge has been placed in the middle so that the bottom could be moved to Halde I. The first terrace is already finished and provided with rails. The second terrace has been tackled; the bottom is loosened with hoes, shoveled into the carrying baskets with patjols (small shovels) and these onto the next
 raised terrace.
 Every worker has his own special job: one chops, the second fills the baskets, and
 the third brings them up. Those workers who drive the car also have to fill it from the baskets. This specialization of work seemed to us the most expedient. The

 strongest people were used for the hard work; The two wagon drivers were also among the best workers, because driving through, changing and turning on the turntables required a great deal of skill; in the beginning, the wagons continually derailed.
 Fig. 2, panel III shows us the status of the work on June 3rd, that is 2> / 4 months later. Levels 1-5 have already been dug up. Terrace I and II have been completely removed, while the track is laid on the third. Only a narrow strip remains of the fourth level, and a few pieces of the fifth, because it was easier to bring the baskets up.
 The bridge in the middle of the pit has been removed and a new one has been built in the south. The terrace height was 1 m. We therefore now had a transport track 2 m lower than in Fig. 1, which made the work of bringing up the ikats (baskets) much easier. A cut was made in the wall opposite the bridge in order to have a short connection with Halde II.
 On the right side you can see a side piece being tackled. In the south, terraces 1 and 2 will be further excavated and a connection with the river will be created in the middle. To the left, where the overseer stands, another side piece of the pit is also made into terraces
 excavated. The sixth terrace has also been almost completely removed.
 Figure 3, panel III is taken 14 days later. The bone layer is now and is being reached
 only edited by two people. The supervisor, Sergeant Bauer, is giving instructions from above to a worker who has dug up a bone. The pumps can be seen in the background on the right. In this pit, too, the various layers can be clearly seen. The black spots on the left wall of the pit are pitches.
 Fig. 4, panel III gives a view of the pit from the end of August; all terraces have been dismantled, a new part is being worked on in the north. In order to drive away the reason now, a new transport route had to be laid. We also tried to use one of our horses for this transport work.
 Small bamboo sticks are rammed into the right wall as a sign of the square division that was carried out in both pits. They were driven into the hanging wall of the bone layer. The pump line can still be seen in the back right; the visible bamboo frame was used to drill a deep water hole and at the same time to try to see whether the lying surface of the black ilfefam'a clay layer could be reached. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in this.
 In the second half of May the water level in the Solo River had become so low that we could also go to work on the left bank of the Solo:
 Fig. 20 shows the beginning of the installation of pit II, north of the dump of the Dussois work, which is visible in the foreground. On the right, where the worker stands, we have found the buffalo skull mentioned above. In this pit there is a bank visible in the Solo River, which was now above water and immediately yielded a lot of bones and teeth that were unfortunately not well preserved.
 At the beginning of June the owner of Madiun gave us 25 workers for a second time, so that, apart from the coolies we had recruited, we could now work with 75 men. After the workers' house had been enlarged accordingly, work on pit II could be carried out on a larger scale. (In pit I, the number of workers had to remain fairly constant due to the gradual extraction system.)
 The steep river bank in pit II, inland from the Dussois excavations, was removed, an easier job than in pit I, but it was dependent on the water level.
 A track was laid along the pit. It was 34.5 m long, 4-5 m wide; the
 Depth was about 2 m below the track. The highest steep face was eight to nine meters high. Of the

 The soil was black, fat clay with numerous limestone concretions, which gave so much that two terraces were laid out to be on the safe side to absorb the ground. But it was most comfortable to work without additional terraces, i. H. just tumble down the bottom of the car.
 Both pits I and II yielded a large number of fossils, among which were very fine specimens, so that the main work was ultimately only directed towards the exploitation of these two pits.
 The dismantling technique was as follows:

 When the bone layer was reached - which was clearly visible from the rather sharp separation of the various layers - then work was continued in such a way that the layer was scraped off with the patjol (pickaxe) until one came across bones. Usually this was shown by a peculiar unpleasant tone

 F. Oppenoorth,
 The bone layer actually consisted of three layers that became increasingly coarse-grained from top to bottom. The upper layer was fine blue tuff with harder clay nodules, the lower layer was coarse-grained and harder with lava
 bombs and bulbs of pumice.
 As a result of the greater resistance of the fossil bones to the surrounding area
 softer volcanic tuff they could mostly be removed without much damage. The hard clay marl bulbs and lava bombs that lay here and there in the layer, especially next to the fossils, caused great difficulty. These pieces of rock then had to be dug up first, and further bones were repeatedly found, so that sometimes one
 whole bone complex was to be detached together.
 1) Incidentally, most of the bones were already stored in a broken state; Some could also be found to have broken safely before they fossilized. In the skull of a young Stegodon No. 203 (cf. Janensch, Die Proboscidier-Skull der Trinil-Expeditions-Sammlung. Pp. 152 and 161, Plate XXI) one of the 30-40 cm long tusks had broken off and turned sideways cemented to the skull with tuff. In many other bones, too, tuff was observed between old fracture surfaces.

 Of course, we have also tried to screen the bones. We had already selected strong sieve material of various hole sizes in Europe and brought them with us, with the intention of possibly sieving the entire main bone layer. However, this soon proved to be an impossibility, as the small lapillic grains immediately settled in the mesh and not a single piece of fossil or bone splinter was found with this method. By the way, we performed for the important bone layers at all
